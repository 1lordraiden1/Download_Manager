# download_app

A new Flutter project to download all types of files you want with one click

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

# Packages I've used :
First Version :

flutter_file_downloader: ^1.2.1 for generic type files.

flutter_media_downloader: ^1.0.4 for media type files.

Second Version : 

dio: ^5.4.3+1.

path_provider: ^2.1.3.

flutter_local_notifications: ^17.0.1.

awesome_notifications: ^0.9.3+1.

#Note :
I added some premissions to this app like pushing notifications and read & write in storage.

I also couldn't add the background toogle option as like as you asked but I searched a lot and I want to know how to do it as feedback for my task 

thank you
